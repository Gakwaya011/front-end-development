            <h1>Mystery</h1><br><br>
            <lorem>The mystery genre is a genre of fiction that follows a crime (like a murder or a disappearance) from
                the
                moment it is committed to the moment it is solved. Mystery novels are often called “whodunnits” because
                they
                turn the reader into a detective trying to figure out the who, what, when, and how of a particular
                crime.
                Most mysteries feature a detective or private eye solving a case as the central character.</lorem>
